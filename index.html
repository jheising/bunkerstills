            <h1>The world's first continuous still<br/>made for the craft distillery</h1>
            <p class="lead">
                The continuous still has revolutionized the alcohol industry, yet the cost and complexity of this amazing technology has rendered it nearly unobtainable to all but the largest distilleries&mdash; until now.

            <p class="lead">
                Bunker Stills is proud to introduce the <strong>Heising-330</strong>, a novel, modern, and fully automated continuous still, built by and for the craft distillery.

                    <div class="lightbox-caption"><p>The Heising-330 prototype still in production use at the Whidbey Island Distillery</p></div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>In the summer of 2010, Bev and Steve Heising and their two sons Jim and Kris opened the <a href="http://www.whidbeydistillery.com">Whidbey Island Distillery</a> (WID) on Whidbey Island, WA.
               Like many other craft distillers, WID began operations with a standard batch still and quickly discovered how much work was required to operate, maintain and clean its still&mdash; not to mention
                the experience required to make accurate and consistent cuts and the time and inefficiency of re-distillation to produce higher proof alcohols. After some months
                of struggling, WID realized that the workload and cost of labor to produce spirits on its batch still was simply unsustainable. There had to be a better way.</p>
            <p>WID's Master Distiller, Steve Heising, knew that continuous distillation might be a solution, but the costs associated with continuous distillation were prohibitive to all but
                the largest distilleries. Yet, as a retired aerospace engineer and physicist, he thought that it should be theoretically possible to produce a reliable and cost-effective continuous
                still, and decided to give it a shot.</p>
            <p>In early 2011, after a few months of research, design and building, WID had crafted an untested prototype still that (in theory) should produce clean alcohol in a continuous fashion. But would
                it work?</p>
            <p>On 3/30/2011 at 3:30 pm, Steve connected a supply of wine to the still and began the heating process. Within minutes, a pure and crisp neutral grape spirit emerged through the parrot. While the
                date and time of the first run was pure coincidence, it seemed only fitting to dedicate the moment when a revolution in distillation began for WID, and quite possibly the rest of
                the craft distillation industry at large. The Heising-330 was born.</p>
            <p>Since that date, the Heising-330 has been tested, refined and updated in the real-world with thousands of gallons of alcohol, and has produced award-winning and top-selling spirits for a loyal legion of fans.</p>

            <h2>See it work</h2>
            <p>The Heising-330 is still undergoing final development and will be available for public and on-site demonstrations soon. But in the meantime, if you're in the Seattle, WA area
            you can schedule a time to visit the <a href="http://www.whidbeydistillery.com">Whidbey Island Distillery</a> for a demo and see it running for yourself. Please contact
                <a href="jim@bunkerstills.com">jim@bunkerstills.com</a> to schedule a demonstration&mdash; we love to talk shop!</p>
            <h2>Find out more</h2>
            <p>Keep tuned in on our progress and get notified when the Heising-330 is ready for you.</p>
